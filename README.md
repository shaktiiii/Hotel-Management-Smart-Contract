# Hotel-Management-Smart-Contract
A hotel management smart contract is a self-executing code on a blockchain network that automates hotel operations and transactions, providing secure, transparent, and tamper-proof management of room bookings, payments, and customer data.

## Getting Started

To use this smart contract, you will need a platform that supports smart contract deployment and execution, such as Ethereum. You will also need a tool such as Remix or Truffle to deploy and test the contract.

## Features
- Security: The smart contract is secured by the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, providing a secure platform for room reservations and payment processing.
- Transparency: All transactions and changes in the smart contract are recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and auditable record.
- Room management: The smart contract enables the management of rooms, including booking status, prices, and room types.
